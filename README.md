# LLM - Emotion
Running LLama-2-7b-chat model in two ways:
1. Training a large LLM
2. Using RAG prompting

To run this, clone the repository and create a folder called models. Download the llama2-chatbot from https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML/blob/main/llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin and paste it in the models folder. Then run the python file called RAG.py with the text as the argument. It should look something like python RAG.py "<enter text>".
